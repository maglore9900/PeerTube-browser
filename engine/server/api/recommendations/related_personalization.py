# Re-rank related (similar) videos using user likes without changing the pool.
#
# This module is a *post-processing* step for related videos returned by recommendations
# when a seed video is provided. It does not perform ANN search, does not add/remove
# candidates, and does not touch cache. It only reorders the existing list, and stamps
# each candidate's final score under `personalized_score`.
# Up-next runs it on the top-M window before the weighted draw; the stamp is the draw
# weight and the page order.
#
# Pipeline:
# 1) Fetch recent likes for the user (limited by max_likes).
# 2) Fetch embeddings for likes and for the candidate pool.
# 3) For each candidate, compute:
#    - base_score: candidate["score"] from similarity search (default 0.0)
#    - user_score: max cosine similarity between candidate vector and any liked vector
# 4) Final score = alpha * base_score + beta * user_score - (1 - alpha) * dislike_penalty,
#    so a candidate's dislike penalty counts in full, as it does on the home feed
# 5) Sort by final score (desc), stable by original index.
#
# If any required data is missing (no user_id, no likes, missing embeddings), the
# input list is returned unchanged.
