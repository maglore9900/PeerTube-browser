# Engine Server

Read-only Engine API for PeerTube Browser recommendations and video metadata.
This service does not own user write/profile endpoints.

## What it does
- `/recommendations` recommendations.
- `/videos/{id}/similar` and `/videos/similar` read aliases.
- `/api/video` metadata for the video page.
- `/internal/videos/resolve` internal read lookup for Client (`video_id/uuid + host`).
- `/internal/videos/metadata` internal metadata batch lookup for Client likes/profile.
- `/internal/dislikes/centroids` clusters a set of disliked videos into up to four taste
  centroids for the Client; nothing is stored.
- `/internal/events/ingest` temporary trusted bridge ingest for normalized events
  (`ENGINE_INGEST_MODE=bridge`).

## Boundary Contract (Engine-side)
- Engine owns read/analytics APIs and internal read/ingest contracts.
- Engine does not own browser-facing write/profile routes (`/api/user-action`, `/api/user-profile/*`).
- Engine runtime must not depend on `engine/server/db/users.db` for recommendation ranking.
- Client backend integration with Engine must go through HTTP contracts, not direct Engine module or DB coupling.

## Notes
- Reads from `DEFAULT_DB_PATH` and FAISS index.
- Recommendation ranking does not depend on local users likes DB; likes, dislike
  centroids and the videos a paging client excludes are read from request-scoped client
  input, and write-derived signals are consumed from aggregated `interaction_signals`.
